# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Notes:

## O(n)
1. find pivot point.(O(n))
2. do two binary search in each side of pivot point.(O(logn)

## O(log n)
1. consider the array as two parts, when cut in the middle, one part is ascending, the other part has a pivot.
2. If the target is in the ascending part, do a binary search. If the target is in the other part. Repeat 1.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def search(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        
        while (l <= r):
            mid = (l + r)/2
            if target == nums[mid]:
                return mid
            if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
                if nums[l] <= target <= nums[mid]:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            else:
                if nums[mid] <= target <= nums[r]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
        return -1
```
