## Notes:

1. Use the first one as the middle value.
2. Two pointers, one at the head, one at the end. They will be stopped at the same position.
3. Swap the middle value and the value which the pointers stop at, if this value is smaller.
4. Recursivly sovle the left part and the right part. Make sure you include the whole range of the array
