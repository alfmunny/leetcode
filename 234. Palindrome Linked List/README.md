# 234. Palindrome Linked List

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

Example 1:

Input: 1->2
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: 1->2->2->1
Output: true


Notes:

Two pointers, determin the middle point and then reverse the rest half. 

Go through the list one more time to compare from both ends.
